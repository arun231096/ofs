+ To invert the value of a boolean, which operator would you use?
+ What is the value of the following expression, and why?
     Integer.valueOf(1).equals(Long.valueOf(1))
+ Create a program that reads an unspecified number of integer arguments from the command line and adds them together.
    For example, suppose that you enter the following: java Adder 1 3 2 10
    The program should display 16 and then exit. The program should display an error message if the user enters only one argument.
+ Create a program that is similar to the previous one but instead of reading integer arguments, it reads floating-point arguments.
    It displays the sum of the arguments, using exactly two digits to the right of the decimal point.
    For example, suppose that you enter the following: java FPAdder 1 1e2 3.0 4.754
    The program would display 108.75. Depending on your locale, the decimal point might be a comma (,) instead of a period (.).
