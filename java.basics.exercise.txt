General Practices:
- no static methods other than the 'main' method, unless the problem explicitly requires you to do that
- use Notepad++ and cmd
- try to find out as many solutions as you can, like case-insensitive String comparision has many solutions. Try to figure out as many as possible.
- objective is that you search, find and understand the API's and NOT just the completion of the excercises
- spend time on reading through other related API classes and methods too, as well as the relevant java tutorial sections

Write a program to,
+ print the absolute path of the .class file of the current class
+ open the source file of the running class in Notepad++ - do NOT hardcode/specify the source file in the code; find the source file using APIs
+ sort and print following String[] alphabetically ignoring case. Also convert and print even indexed Strings into uppercase
+       { "Madurai", "Thanjavur", "TRICHY", "Karur", "Erode", "trichy", "Salem" }
+ demonstrate varargs param with other params
+ demonstrate object equality using Object.equals() vs ==, using String objects
+ print fibinocci using for loop, while loop and recursion
+ create a Employee class with properties: id and name, a constructor which initializes name, a mechanism to automatically assign id by incrementing 
  the previous id. Create and print 10 employee objects using Object.toString()
+ list down the differences between the classname of arrays of primitive types and String
+ print the type of the result value of following expressions
  - 100 / 24
  - 100.10 / 10
  - 'Z' / 2
  - 10.5 / 0.5
  - 12.4 % 5.5
  - 100 % 56
+ demonstrate what happens when mixing primitive with respective Wrapper types for the above operations
+ demonstrate inheritance, overloading, overriding using Animal, Dog, Cat and Snake class of objects
+ demonstrate overloading with varargs
+ demonstrate overloading with Wrapper types
- print the classname of all the primitive data types (Note: not the wrapper types)
